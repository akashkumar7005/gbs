Whenever you access Gmail, edit your documents, or search for information on Google, you're using one of our data centers and have the power of a supercomputer at your fingertips.

Our large-scale procurement of wind and solar power is a cornerstone of our sustainability efforts, and has made Google the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy.
